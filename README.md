# IcyPhoenix-Styles
Add-on Styles (Templates) Ported For Icy Phoenix CMS

The templates in this Repo are templates that others have created. Some authors I was able to get ahead of and others I was not. I am leaving 100% credits intact as should you if you ever grab one. If you do and remove credits, do not ever ask me for help. I believe in credit where credit is due. Even if the website and author are long gone. Poe is gone and we still give him credit right?

These styles/templates, which ever you prefer, are NOT complete. I would not under any circumstance try to use them under any circumstance unless I expressly say on the Read Me that it is ready to roll. I will also give the Icy Phoenix CMS version that it is compatible with.

As am I free to alter and redistribute, so are you. HOWEVER, the license MUST be maintained, ALL credits must remain, and you can not ever profit from them. You may take donations to install or alter, but you may never offer for sale the templates from this page. You may not offer the template as a "Feature" of a pre modded package. No money period!!!

I do not claim any ownership at all of the Templates/styles in this repo, nor do I claim ownership or Icy Pheonix or Integramod or IMPortal. Icy Pheonix can be located at http://www.icyphoenix.com/ . IntegraMOD and IMPortal can be found at https://sourceforge.net/projects/integra2/ . 

I would be careful with those files at Sourceforge for Integra. I do not think they are up to date. I would look at my files for updated downloads. I am going to try to keep them up to date the best I can. I am pretty much a one man show trying to keep an old project alive for the rare person still looking for a decent package.

The Icy Pheonix files are very fresh and up to date and can be found at the link I provided. I am a new user there so I can't fill you in to much other than it is a decent project and that is why I have decided to try a tempalte or two for them.

That is about all for now. This ReadMe, is subject to change without notice.
