# IcyPhoenix-Styles
Add-on Styles (Templates) Ported For Icy Phoenix CMS

The templates in this Repo are templates that others have created. Some authors I was able to get a hold of and others I was not. I am leaving 100% credits intact as should you if you ever grab one. If you do and remove credits, do not ever ask me for help. I believe in credit where credit is due. Even if the website and author are long gone. Poe is gone and we still give him credit right?

These styles/templates, which ever you prefer, are NOT complete. I would not under any circumstance try to use them under any circumstance unless I expressly say on the Read Me that it is ready to roll. I will also give the Icy Phoenix CMS version that it is compatible with.

I do not claim any ownership at all of the Templates/styles in this repo, nor do I claim ownership or Icy Pheonix or Integramod or IMPortal. Icy Pheonix can be located at http://www.icyphoenix.com/ . IntegraMOD and IMPortal can be found at https://sourceforge.net/projects/integra2/ . PLEASE NOTE: All the files for Integramod or IMPortal at Sourceforge are NOT up to date. My files are probably your best bet and at this time, they are a no go.

The Icy Pheonix files are very fresh and up to date and can be found at the link I provided. I am a new user there so I can't fill you in to much other than it is a decent project and that is why I have decided to try a tempalte or two for them.

**EDIT**

The Integra2 style is done. You can download it and use it on Icy Phoenix v2.2.0.105. I would come back and check soon for a new updated version. I have new images and looks in the works as we speak.

The Dark style is NOT ready for any version. DO NOT USE IT! I will update this when it is ready to use. If you use it, do not come here or IcyPhoenix and ask for help.
