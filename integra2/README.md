style for icy phoenix


Hello everyone. My name is Ray. I go by MWE_001 on various sites on the web.

My most notable use of the name MWE_001 was on the website Integramod. Integramod stood for Integrated Modifications. Integramod was a portal and many mods built on the phpBB platform. I was never a big person admin wise really. I did do some very minor work to IM Portal 3.0 as well as a few styles. I sure kept the spammers at bay! I hung out for a long time until nothing was going on and it was weeks in between admin visiting the site. I then knew it was time to move on.

Now days, sadly enough, Integramod has gone down. I have moved on to a project called Icy Phoenix ran by Mighty Gorgon. The creator of Full Album Pack for phpBB. I have hopefully helped the guys over there fix a few bugs and worked out some kinks for them in their plugins.

Now days, I am wanting to jump in and do a Style or two for them as well. I can not do them from scratch as my skills do not allow for that. What I can do is graphics and do a clone and make it my own and obviously leaving the credits intact for the original template and creators.

This template I am attempting to "Clone" and then radically change is a template by Mighty Gorgon. I am using his template Milky Way as a base. The style I am attempting to create is the Integra2 style that was a big hit on Integramod starting with version Integramod 1.4.1. This style was a big project of Teelk and Helter Skelter if I am not mistaken. The images I am using come from http://forumimages.us/forum/portal.php. I talked to John (Helter Skelter) about using the iamges once before and I had 100% permission as I was not making any money off of them. Nor am I going to now. It is just rightful that I ask his permission to distribute the theme as wellas use the images.

As usual, I do NOT claim any ownership of Integramod, IM Portal, Integra2 style, Milkyway style, or Icy Phoenix.

THIS COMMIT IS NOT COMPLETE! DO NOT INSTALL TO A ICY PHOENIX WEBSITE! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!

It's getting closer but not quite there yet.
